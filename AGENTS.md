# AGENTS.md

Dedicated game server containers for Unraid. Three games live here today: **ARK:
Survival Ascended** and **V Rising** (Debian + SteamCMD pulling the Windows depot,
run under GE-Proton — V Rising additionally needs a virtual display) and
**Terraria** (Debian, native Linux binary — no SteamCMD, no Proton). Target
platform is Unraid; each game's `docker-compose.yml` is for local testing only.

## Layout

| Path                                   | What it is                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `games/<slug>/Dockerfile`              | Image definition for that game. Built with the repo root as context. |
| `games/<slug>/docker-compose.yml`      | Local testing only. Uses uid/gid 1000, not Unraid's 99/100. |
| `games/<slug>/scripts/`                | Game-specific scripts, copied to `/opt/scripts` in the image. |
| `games/<slug>/docs/dockerhub.md`       | Docker Hub long description, synced by CI on release. |
| `games/<slug>/README.md`               | That game's guide — except ASA, see Constraints.    |
| `shared/scripts/rcon.py`               | Minimal Source RCON client, shared by every game with RCON. No dependencies beyond stdlib. |
| `shared/scripts/rcon-cli.sh`           | Thin wrapper for `docker exec` use.                 |
| `games/terraria/scripts/console.sh`    | Sends a command through Terraria's FIFO console.    |
| `shared/scripts/start.sh`              | Common root entrypoint, runs as root. Reconciles the `steam` uid/gid, fixes ownership, then `gosu` to that game's `start-server.sh`. |
| `shared/scripts/proton.sh`             | GE-Proton install, prefix management and `wineserver_kill`. Sourced by ASA and V Rising. |
| `shared/scripts/steamcmd.sh`           | SteamCMD bootstrap, the app update and its retired-manifest recovery, and the `HOME` repoint. Sourced by ASA and V Rising. |
| `templates/<slug>.xml`                 | Unraid Community Apps template for that game. CA requires one XML per app under `templates/`. |
| `ca_profile.xml`                       | CA repository profile, covering every game here. Must be at the root with a non-empty `<Profile>`, or submission is blocked. |
| `icon.png` / `icon.svg`                | ASA's icons, referenced by `ca_profile.xml` and its template. |
| `terraria.png` / `terraria.svg`        | Terraria's icons.                                    |
| `tools/icongen/`                       | Generates the per-game icon PNGs from source art.    |
| `tests/unit.sh`                        | Plain-assertion unit tests, no framework.            |
| `tests/e2e-terraria.sh`                | Boot/shutdown end-to-end test against a built Terraria image. |
| `.github/workflows/build.yml`          | CI: lints, builds every game, publishes on a `<slug>/v<version>` tag. |

## Build

```sh
docker build -f games/ark-survival-ascended/Dockerfile -t asa-test .
docker build -f games/terraria/Dockerfile -t terraria-test .
docker build -f games/v-rising/Dockerfile -t vrising-test .
```

## Test

There is no unit test framework beyond plain assertions. The checks that must
pass before a change ships:

```sh
shellcheck --severity=warning shared/scripts/*.sh games/*/scripts/*.sh tests/*.sh
python3 -m py_compile shared/scripts/rcon.py
bash tests/unit.sh
bash tests/e2e-terraria.sh terraria-test     # Terraria only; ASA's boot pulls ~13GB
```

Terraria's install is ~46MB and its e2e test above covers a real boot and
shutdown, so it needs no manual check beyond that. ASA and V Rising are the
opposite: their boots pull ~13GB and ~2GB, so both stay manual smoke runs — start
one and confirm it reaches the SteamCMD step and prints the resolved uid/gid,
then stop it there:

```sh
docker run --rm -e UID=1000 -e GID=1000 asa-test
docker run --rm -e UID=1000 -e GID=1000 vrising-test
```

## Constraints

- **Release tags are `<slug>/v<version>`.** e.g. `ark-survival-ascended/v1.5.0`.
  A bare `v1.2.3` triggers nothing at all.
- **ASA has no `games/ark-survival-ascended/README.md`.** Its guide is the root
  `README.md`, because every installed CA template's `<ReadMe>` freezes that
  URL and those users never receive a new template. This is deliberate, not an
  oversight — do not add one and do not point the ASA template's `<ReadMe>`
  anywhere else. Every other game gets `games/<slug>/README.md`.
- **Terraria's `STOP_TIMEOUT` is `6`, not ASA's `120`.** `6` plus a bounded 3s
  wait for the log reader must stay under Docker's 10s default stop grace
  (6+3=9s). Do not copy ASA's value over.
- **All three images run as the account `steam`, Terraria included**, because
  `shared/scripts/start.sh` hardcodes it in the `gosu` call.
- **`UID` is also a bash variable.** In `shared/scripts/start.sh` it is read
  into `TARGET_UID` rather than used directly, and `PUID`/`PGID` are accepted
  as aliases. Do not "simplify" that back to bare `${UID}`.
- **Terraria's stdout never gets piped to a live reader.** The runner
  (`games/terraria/scripts/start-server.sh`) writes the server's stdout to a
  plain file and mirrors a collapsed view of it into the container log
  separately. This is not cosmetic: Terraria emits one line per 0.1% of every
  worldgen/save phase, and piping that live into a reader makes the server
  itself run roughly 20x slower and can wedge the container log entirely.
  `VERBOSE_LOG=true` bypasses the collapsing for diagnosis without touching how
  the server itself is run. Do not "simplify" this into a live pipe.
- **Windows depot, not Linux (ASA only).** ASA has no native Linux server
  binary. SteamCMD is given `+@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows` and the exe
  runs under Proton. amd64 only — an arm64 image would be meaningless.
- **`ServerAdminPassword` must be the last `?` argument (ASA).** Anything after
  it is swallowed into the password value. See the ordering in
  `games/ark-survival-ascended/scripts/start-server.sh`.
- **Dash flags, not query params (ASA).** `-WinLiveMaxPlayers=` and `-port=`
  are the real settings; `?MaxPlayers=` and `?Port=` are silently ignored by
  ASA.
- **The config seed is write-once (ASA).** `GameUserSettings.ini` is written
  only when absent. Never make the container rewrite a file the user may have
  edited. Terraria's `serverconfig.txt` is the opposite by design — it is
  regenerated every boot, since Terraria only reads it at startup.
- **`HOME` is repointed at `<serverfiles>/home` (ASA).** `gosu` sets it from
  passwd, so `start-server.sh` overrides it after the privilege drop, not via
  `ENV`. SteamCMD's `depotcache` lives there and holds the manifest an
  incremental update diffs against. On the default `/home/steam` it is lost
  whenever the container is recreated, and the next update dies with
  `Access Denied` on the delta-source manifest because Steam does not issue
  request codes for superseded manifests. Do not move it back.
- **V Rising needs a display (V Rising only).** `VRisingServer.exe` will not
  start without one, headless or not, so the launch goes through `xvfb-run`. Both
  reference containers upstream do the same. Do not "simplify" it away.
- **V Rising's config is never rewritten (V Rising only).** Every
  `ServerHostSettings.json` field has a command-line override that beats the file,
  so the template's fields are passed as launch flags and the seeded JSON is left
  alone forever. Do not "fix" this by making the container write JSON — that is
  what would destroy a user's hand edits.
- **V Rising's shutdown does not use RCON (V Rising only).** It saves on SIGTERM.
  The signal must reach `VRisingServer.exe` itself, identified by
  `/proc/<pid>/comm` against the 15-character truncation `VRisingServer.e`. Both
  wrappers — `xvfb-run` and the Proton launcher — carry the exe name on their
  command lines, so `pkill -f` hits them too, and signalling a wrapper orphans the
  game while the log reports a clean stop.
- **Graceful shutdown depends on RCON (ASA).** `SaveWorld` then `DoExit` over
  RCON, then a timed wait, then kill the wine prefix. A hard kill loses world
  state. Terraria has no RCON; its shutdown writes `exit` into a FIFO console
  instead (`games/terraria/scripts/console.sh`).
