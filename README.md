A SteamCMD-based ASA dedicated server container, laid out the way ich777's game
server images are, so it should feel familiar if you were running his: the same
`/serverdata/steamcmd` + `/serverdata/serverfiles` split, the same `UID`/`GID`/
`VALIDATE`/`USERNAME` environment variables, the same "download everything on
first boot so the image stays small" approach.

The one structural difference is Proton. Wildcard still ships no native Linux
server binary for ASA, so this installs the **Windows** depot (SteamCMD is told
`+@sSteamCmdForcePlatformType windows`) and runs `ArkAscendedServer.exe` under
GE-Proton.

## What this one does differently

The download is the easy part. Almost everything that goes wrong with a
dedicated ASA server happens afterwards, and this container is built around
four of those failures in particular.

**You can actually edit the config files.** Getting an ini file editable over
SMB from a Windows box needs three things to line up at once: the files have to
be owned by the right uid, they have to carry permissive modes, and every
directory above them has to be traversable. Permissive files behind a locked
parent are still unreachable, which is why the top-level mode defaults to `775`
rather than the tighter `770` you might expect. The permission pass runs on
every start *and* again on shutdown, so it repairs a migrated install or files
wine created with its own tight modes, not just the ones created from here on.
`CONFIG_UMASK` translates a plain umask into the two modes it implies, applying
them to files and directories separately so directories keep the execute bit
that makes them possible to enter. Full detail in
[Editing the configs over SMB](#editing-the-configs-over-smb-from-windows).

**Stopping the container saves the world.** ARK writes its save on exit, so a
hard kill is how people lose hours. On `docker stop` this sends `SaveWorld` over
RCON, waits, sends `DoExit`, and only kills the wine prefix if the server is
still up after `STOP_TIMEOUT`. That is also why the entrypoint deliberately does
not use process-group signalling — it would deliver SIGTERM straight to the wine
processes and skip the save entirely.

**The container never overwrites your edits.** `GameUserSettings.ini` is seeded
once, with RCON enabled, and then left alone permanently — there is no code path
here that rewrites a config file you may have changed. ARK itself is a different
matter: it rewrites that file when it shuts down, so stop the container before
editing rather than while it runs.

**The install is located, not assumed.** The server binary is found by searching
for it rather than by hardcoding `ShooterGame/Binaries/Win64`. That layout has
shifted before, and it means an existing install laid out by some other setup is
found rather than ignored.

Two smaller things. GE-Proton splits its releases by architecture, and the ARM
build sorts first in the release listing, so the x86_64 tarball is selected
explicitly rather than by taking whichever tarball appears first; pinning
accepts either the release tag or the full asset name. And if GitHub is
unreachable or rate-limiting you, the container falls back to whatever Proton
build is already on disk instead of refusing to boot. The RCON client is a short
Python script using nothing outside the standard library, so there is no extra
package to install or keep current just to send `SaveWorld`.

## Before you start

- **Disk:** about 15GB installed, growing with saves and mods. Put it on a cache
  pool or SSD share rather than the array — not for the space, but because ARK
  is heavy on random I/O and spinning disks make startup and world saves
  noticeably slower.
- **RAM:** 16GB is a sensible floor for a vanilla map. Mods and players push it
  well past that. ASA is considerably hungrier than ASE.
- **First boot is slow and quiet.** A ~13GB download, then Proton builds its
  prefix, then the server does its own startup — around 45 seconds once the
  files are in place. Watch the logs rather than assuming it has hung.

## Get the image

```bash
docker pull ferment9348/ark-survival-ascended:latest
```

Tagged releases are published as `:1.2.3` and `:1.2`, and `:latest` always points
at the most recent release rather than at the tip of `main`.

Or build it yourself — on Unraid you can do this on the server itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blckassassin/unraid-game-servers.git
cd unraid-game-servers
docker build -t ferment9348/ark-survival-ascended:latest .
```

If you build under a different name, change `<Repository>` in
`templates/ark-survival-ascended.xml` to match.

## Install on Unraid

1. Copy `templates/ark-survival-ascended.xml` to
   `/boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/`.
2. Docker tab → **Add Container** → pick `ARK-Survival-Ascended` from the
   template dropdown.
3. Set your paths, server name and admin password, then apply.

## Ports

| Port  | Proto | What it does                                              |
| ----- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7777  | UDP   | Game traffic. **The only one you have to forward.**        |
| 7778  | UDP   | Peer port. Rarely needed; worth trying for flaky connects. |
| 27015 | UDP   | Legacy Steam query port. Vestigial in ASA — see below.     |
| 27020 | TCP   | RCON. Forward only if you administer from outside the LAN. |

Server discovery in ASA runs through Epic Online Services, not Steam's A2S query
protocol, so you do **not** need to forward 27015 for your server to appear in
the Unofficial list. It is mapped only because some third-party tooling still
expects it to exist.

To run the game on a different port, change it in three places to the same
number: the mapping's container port, the mapping's host port, and `GAME_PORT`.
Docker gives the container no way to discover which host port it was published
on, so the server can only report the number it binds — keeping the three equal
is what makes the startup log name the port players actually type. A mismatch is
quiet rather than loud: a bind port different from the container port leaves
nothing behind the mapping and no error in the log. The peer port is derived by
the engine as game port + 1 and has no variable, so move that mapping to match.

The query and RCON ports need none of this. Nothing reports them back to you, so
mapping a different host port to them works on its own.

Container ports are namespaced, so this server holding 7777 and another game
container holding 7777 never collide however they are mapped. Only host ports
have to be unique, and only within a protocol.

## Configuration

Environment variables of note:

| Variable            | Default          | Notes                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SERVER_NAME`       | `ASA Server`     | Session name in the server browser.                                        |
| `MAP`               | `TheIsland_WP`   | Needs the `_WP` suffix — the bare ASE name will not load.                  |
| `MAX_PLAYERS`       | `20`             | Becomes `-WinLiveMaxPlayers`.                                              |
| `GAME_PORT`         | `7777`           | Port the server binds and reports in the log. Keep it equal to both sides of the port mapping. |
| `SRV_PWD`           | empty            | Join password. Blank for an open server.                                   |
| `SRV_ADMIN_PWD`     | `adminpassword`  | Admin **and** RCON password. Change it.                                    |
| `MODS`              | empty            | Comma-separated CurseForge project IDs.                                    |
| `CROSSPLAY`         | `false`          | `true` adds `-crossplay` so Epic players can join.                         |
| `BATTLEYE`          | `false`          | `false` passes `-NoBattlEye`.                                              |
| `GAME_PARAMS_EXTRA` | empty            | Extra dash flags, space separated.                                         |
| `QUERY_PARAMS_EXTRA`| empty            | Extra `?key=value` pairs, no leading `?`.                                  |
| `CLUSTER_ID`        | empty            | Same value on every server in a cluster.                                   |
| `PROTON_VERSION`    | `GE-Proton10-34` | Pinned deliberately — see below. `latest` is opt-in.                       |
| `VALIDATE`          | empty            | `true` makes SteamCMD verify every file on start. Slow.                    |
| `DEBUG`             | `false`          | `true` captures verbose wine output and a Proton log. See below.           |
| `STOP_TIMEOUT`      | `120`            | Seconds allowed for a graceful save before force kill.                     |
| `FIX_PERMS`         | `true`           | Keeps the `Saved` tree editable over SMB. See below.                       |
| `CONFIG_UMASK`      | inherits `UMASK` | umask applied to the `Saved` tree. See below.                              |
| `DATA_PERM`         | `775`            | Mode on the top-level server files folder.                                 |
| `UMASK`             | `000`            | New files 666, new directories 777.                                        |

### The launch-argument traps

ASA moved several settings off the `?`-string and onto dash flags, and the old
forms are **silently ignored** rather than erroring:

- `-WinLiveMaxPlayers=N` sets the player cap. `?MaxPlayers=` does nothing.
- `-port=N` sets the game port. `?Port=` does nothing.
- `ServerAdminPassword` must be the **last** `?` argument — anything after it
  gets swallowed into the password value. The script already handles this, but
  keep it in mind if you add your own `QUERY_PARAMS_EXTRA`.
- Mods are CurseForge project IDs, not Steam Workshop IDs. A Workshop-only mod
  is not an ASA mod.

### INI files

`GameUserSettings.ini` and `Game.ini` live in:

```
<serverfiles>/ShooterGame/Saved/Config/WindowsServer/
```

That path says `WindowsServer` even though you are on Linux — you are running
the Windows binary, and ASA has no `LinuxServer` variant.

For convenience a `config` symlink is created at the top of the game files
folder, so you can also reach them at `<serverfiles>/config/`. If your Samba
setup has `follow symlinks` disabled the shortcut will not show up over the
network — use the full path in that case.

The container seeds `GameUserSettings.ini` with RCON enabled on first run and
then **never touches it again**, so your edits are safe.

**Stop the container before editing.** ARK rewrites `GameUserSettings.ini` when
it shuts down, so changes you make while it is running get overwritten.

## Editing the configs over SMB from Windows

This is set up to work out of the box. Three things have to line up, and the
container handles all of them:

1. **Ownership.** Everything is chowned to your `UID`/`GID`, which on Unraid
   defaults to `99:100` (`nobody:users`) — the ids Unraid's SMB stack expects.
2. **File modes.** `UMASK=000` means files the server creates land as `666` and
   directories as `777`. On top of that, `FIX_PERMS=true` re-applies those modes
   across the `Saved` tree on every start *and* again on shutdown, which repairs
   anything that already exists with a tight mode — a migrated install, or files
   wine created itself.
3. **Traversal.** Permissive files are useless if a parent directory blocks the
   way in, so the chain down to `Saved` is opened up too. This is why
   `DATA_PERM` defaults to `775` and not ich777's `770`: with `770`, an SMB user
   who is neither the owner nor a member of group `100` cannot get in at all.

### Tightening it: `CONFIG_UMASK`

`CONFIG_UMASK` is a plain umask, and it means what you would expect — files
start from `666`, directories from `777`, and the umask bits come off. Leave it
blank and it just follows the container-wide `UMASK`, so by default there is a
single number governing everything.

| `CONFIG_UMASK` | Files | Dirs  | Who can edit over SMB                         |
| -------------- | ----- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `000` (default)| `666` | `777` | Anyone.                                       |
| `007`          | `660` | `770` | Owner and group `users` only.                 |
| `022`          | `644` | `755` | Nobody but the owner — read-only for you.     |
| `077`          | `600` | `700` | Owner only. Not editable over SMB at all.     |

`007` is the sensible choice if `000` feels too open: Unraid accounts belong to
the `users` group (gid `100`), so SMB editing keeps working while everything
else is shut out. Note that `022` and `077` will make the files **read-only or
invisible** from Windows — that is the intended meaning, but it is the opposite
of what you asked for, so pick them deliberately.

An invalid value falls back to `000` with a warning in the log rather than
failing the boot.

`CONFIG_UMASK` sets what the modes become; `FIX_PERMS` decides whether the pass
runs at all. Set `FIX_PERMS=false` to skip it entirely and manage permissions
yourself — there is no umask value that means "leave these alone".

Two things on the Unraid side that this container cannot do for you:

- The **appdata share must be exported over SMB**. It often is not by default.
  Shares → appdata → *SMB Security Settings*.
- If permissions are already tangled from a previous container, run **Tools →
  Docker Safe New Permissions** once with the containers stopped, or start this
  one with `FORCE_CHOWN=true` for a single boot.

Use an editor that respects existing line endings — Notepad++ or VS Code rather
than stock Notepad — for the larger ini files.

### Watching the server

The engine log is streamed into the container log, so ARK's own output appears
under **Logs** on the Unraid Docker tab, or via `docker logs`, alongside this
container's `---...---` messages. You do not need shell access to see what the
server is doing.

The file itself is still at `ShooterGame/Saved/Logs/ShooterGame.log` if you want
to search back through it.

### Passwords end up in the engine log

This container prints `<query string hidden>` instead of the launch arguments,
but ARK itself writes the whole command line — `ServerPassword` and
`ServerAdminPassword` in clear text — into
`ShooterGame/Saved/Logs/ShooterGame.log`. Nothing here can prevent that.

Worth knowing before you paste a log into a forum or an issue, and a reason to
treat that file as sensitive. `ServerAdminPassword` is also the RCON password.

## Stopping safely

ARK writes its world on exit, so a hard kill is how people lose hours of
progress. On `docker stop` the container sends `SaveWorld`, then `DoExit` over
RCON, waits up to `STOP_TIMEOUT` seconds, and only then kills the wine prefix.

This depends on RCON being enabled in `GameUserSettings.ini`. If you disable it,
you lose the safe shutdown.

**On Unraid, raise the container stop timeout** (Settings → Docker →
*Default shutdown time-out*) to something above your `STOP_TIMEOUT`. Unraid's
default is far shorter than a graceful ARK shutdown takes, so it will SIGKILL
the container partway through.

You can tell this has happened: the log reaches `---Sending DoExit---` and then
just stops, without `---Server stopped---`. The save itself completes before
that point — `World Saved` comes back from RCON first — so it is not data loss,
but the server never gets to shut down cleanly.

## RCON from the command line

```bash
docker exec ARK-Survival-Ascended /opt/scripts/rcon-cli.sh SaveWorld
docker exec ARK-Survival-Ascended /opt/scripts/rcon-cli.sh ListPlayers
docker exec ARK-Survival-Ascended /opt/scripts/rcon-cli.sh "Broadcast Restart in 5 minutes"
```

Worth knowing: ASA moderation commands take a player's **EOS ID**, not a
Steam64 ID.

## Clusters

Set the same `CLUSTER_ID` on each container and point every one of them at a
shared `CLUSTER_DIR` (map the same host path into each container). Give each
server its own `GAME_PORT` and its own serverfiles path. Proton lives inside
that folder, so each server automatically gets its own wine prefix — two
servers cannot end up sharing one. The SteamCMD folder is the exception: it is
only a downloader, so pointing every container at the same one is fine.

## Troubleshooting

**Server never appears in the list.** Check 7777/udp is forwarded to the Unraid
host. If only Epic players cannot see it, set `CROSSPLAY=true`.

**Crashes on startup, or wine errors about file descriptors.** The container
raises its own limit, but the Docker-level ceiling matters too — the template
passes `--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576` in Extra Parameters. Make sure that
survived any edits you made.

**Cannot open or save the ini files from Windows.** Check the appdata share is
actually exported over SMB, then confirm `FIX_PERMS` is `true` and restart the
container — the recursive fix runs on start. If it is still wrong, the files are
probably owned by the wrong uid; start once with `FORCE_CHOWN=true`.

**Out-of-memory or mmap errors under load.** Unreal engine servers can exhaust
the default `vm.max_map_count`. On the Unraid host:

```bash
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

Add it to your `go` file to make it stick across reboots.

**Server exits a second after startup, engine log stops after Sentry.** That is
Proton's `lsteamclient` failing to find the native `steamclient.so` and
aborting the process. It looks for `~/.steam/sdk64/steamclient.so`, which the
container links from SteamCMD automatically. If you see
`unable to load native steamclient library` in a `DEBUG=true` log, check that
SteamCMD actually finished its first run — the libraries only appear after it
has downloaded its own payload.

**A Proton update broke something.** `PROTON_VERSION` is pinned to
`GE-Proton10-34` rather than tracking `latest`, so an upstream release cannot
change what runs here without you choosing it. That is the whole reason for the
pin: reproducibility, not a belief that newer builds are broken.

**Do not set `latest`.** GE-Proton 11 hangs `ArkAscendedServer.exe` before the
engine writes anything at all — no crash, no exception, no log, the container
simply never comes up. Verified directly with this image on 2026-08-20:
GE-Proton11-5 hung indefinitely while GE-Proton10-34 reached "advertising for
join" in 44 seconds, on the same machine with the same game files and only the
Proton build changed. The maintainer of another Linux ASA launcher reported the
same behaviour against GE-Proton11-1 in July 2026, so it spans the series
rather than one build.

This failure is silent by nature, so the container also warns if no engine
output has appeared several minutes after launch.

The container warns in its log whenever the Proton build in use is not the one
the image was tested against, so a container still carrying an older
`PROTON_VERSION` setting says so on every start rather than failing silently.

Changing `PROTON_VERSION` is enough on its own. A wine prefix belongs to the
build that created it, so the container records which one that was and discards
the prefix when it changes, letting Proton rebuild. You do not have to delete
anything by hand, and your saves and configs are never involved — they live
under `ShooterGame/Saved`, not in the prefix. Deleting `<serverfiles>/proton` forces a clean prefix rebuild, which is
worth trying before anything drastic — that folder holds only the Proton build
and the wine prefix, both of which are rebuilt automatically. Your saves and
configs are under `ShooterGame/`, untouched.

**SteamCMD keeps failing partway.** Steam's CDN deprioritises anonymous logins
under load. Set `VALIDATE=true` and restart; it resumes rather than starting
over.

**The update never starts at all — `state is 0x6`, `0 / 0` bytes.** Steam stops
issuing manifest request codes for a depot's old manifest once a new build
ships, and SteamCMD asks for the installed manifest as its delta source before
it downloads anything. Once that manifest is retired the request comes back
`Access Denied` and the whole update is cancelled, so the server keeps booting
the old build no matter how often you restart. `VALIDATE=true` does not help,
because the delta-source request happens first. The container recognises this
and recovers on its own: it moves `steamapps/appmanifest_<appid>.acf` aside —
that file is where the stale manifest is recorded — and retries with validate,
keeping the displaced file as `.stale`. Your saves and configs are not involved.

What puts you in that position is losing SteamCMD's `depotcache`, which holds
the manifest an incremental update diffs against. Normally it is read from disk
and Steam is never asked. SteamCMD keeps it under `$HOME`, so the container
points `HOME` at `<serverfiles>/home` to keep it on a mapped volume; left at the
default it would live in the container's writable layer and be destroyed every
time the container is recreated from a new image.
